  Fedora installer has a bug - bootc system can only be installed with automatic disk partitioning(via GUI), manual disk partitioning doesn't have supported scripts for bootc system
  # Run in terminal
  On first boot, open the terminal and COPY-PASTE-ENTER
  `sudo rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/vst-nameublue-aurora-dx:latest`
